Quote from Sandra Varghese:
> It was actually very motivational. I didn't know much about coding, but I wanted to learn more. I'm really greatful to Charity and others who actually stood up and motivated us. Now I've started learning code everyday. And because of it I've encouraged my collegemates to learn coding as well

Quote from Charity Kithaka:
> Listening to women in their hometown who face the same challenges and still made it to the event was such an inspiration
