> Hack Camp 2020 was the first Hackathon I ever attended outside my hometown. I had so much fun coding and tinkering. It surely helped me broaden my perspectives and experience. This event was an incredible opportunity to interact with remarkable people in the tech industry and listen to them share their knowledge. Last but not the least, Free swags and food was the cherry on top of the entire event. Overall it was a wonderful event in all aspects. Super grateful and happy to have been able to attend this event and I really look forward to participating next year.

> I was able to learn and build things which I  never thought I could. I definitely think events like these enable us to realize one's potential, learn and do things in such a short span of time. It was really wonderful to gain new skills in just two days which otherwise would have taken me two months. Thanks to Hack Club for providing us this opportunity.

> It didn't feel like a competition to me because everyone was so supportive to the beginners. I signed up by myself and teamed up with 3 people I'd never met before. All my teammates were at their first hackathon. Really hack camp was a great success, thanks to all the hackcamp coordinators and family members.

Well, I'm saying this because hack camp gave me a platform to think upon my latest project. I got to meet some interesting people at Hack Camp and was really inspired by them. Altogether it was a wonderful experience and I really enjoyed it.
